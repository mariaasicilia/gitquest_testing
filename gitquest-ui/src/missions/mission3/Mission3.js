You just executed the exact workflow professional software teams run every week — branch, work, stash through an interruption, sync, integrate, clean up. You also now command BOTH integration strategies: merge preserves the parallel history, rebase replays it clean.\n\nOne target remains: Shadow Breach's leadership and their Ghost Protocol contingency. What comes next is Git's most powerful and most dangerous tier.\n\nMission 4 clearance granted. This is where most agents stop. You won't.`,
